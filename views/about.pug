        .about-bio

          p I am a dedicated and hard working professional that strives to learn and advance in every aspect of my life. I believe in the strength of my attention to detail and ability to handle many tasks in a fast paced environment.
          p I push myself to learn as I go and acquire the necessary skills for the job. I enjoy honing those skills and seeking further opportunities to learn and grow so that I may continue to be an asset for my team.
          p I can be found working with computers every day when I am not spending time with my family and our dogs. And I believe I would play a vital role in any team that I join.
